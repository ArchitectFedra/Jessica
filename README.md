# Jessica
A repository for my ethical ai assistant. This runs using KL3M as the base. Ideally, users will put their own writings in the personal-writings text document. The transcripts are originally generated using Gemini and rewritten, but will eventually be replaced fully with human answers. Nothing is stolen, and it should be able to help you ethically.
# What is the Jessica Project?
Jessica is my 10-year-long atempt to create an AI model that runs using non-stolen data. This uses KL3M as the LLM dataset, which is heavily documented and trained in detail here: <https://aleainstitute.ai/blog/posts/kl3m-models-huggingface/>
The idea is that this is what I have wanted to build as a kid. A highly trainable and customizable AI model. Think Jarvis from the Iron Man comics. Eventually, users will be able to plug and play their own writings into this database, allowing for confidence that your writing, organizing, and management is done by an AI completely based off of you and your needs.
# Who is this for?
Writers, creatives, and people who want to use AI ethically. This is in direct protest to NaNoWriMo, and their partership with AI companies that are trained on stolen data. If your hang up with AI is the stolen data, you may find my project useful
# Why would you make this?
I started using a free trial of Gemini and loved the _idea_ of LLMs. Some of my friends and colleague in the software industry run local models trained on their own code. I thought what if I could do the same thing, but for writing, organizing, and creative work? This will be an ongoing documentation of my work, to see how far I can get and what I can learn about LLMs, coding, and app creation by the time I am 40.
# Why the name Jessica?
Jessica stans for: "Just Every Stupid Stanza I Can Add". In reality, Jessica is juts a name picked from J names. My real name begins with a J, and Jarvis also begins with a J, so it fits.
