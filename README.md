A repository for my ethical ai assistant. This runs using KL3M as the base. Ideally, users will put their own writings in the personal-writings text document. The transcripts are originally generated using Gemini and rewritten, but will eventually be replaced fully with human answers. Nothing is stolen, and it should be able to help you ethically.
